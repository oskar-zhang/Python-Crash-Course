"""
This example also demonstrates the idea that every function should
have one specific job. The first function prints each design, and the second
displays the completed models. This is more beneficial than using one function
to do both jobs. If youâ€™re writing a function and notice the function
is doing too many different tasks, try to split the code into two functions.
Remember that you can always call a function from another function,
which can be helpful when splitting a complex task into a series of steps.

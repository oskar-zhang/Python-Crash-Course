# In this chapter

"""
I learned how to write functions and to pass arguments
so that your functions have access to the information they need to do their
work.
"""

# I learned how to use positional and keyword arguments, and how to accept 
# an arbitrary number of arguments.

"""
I saw functions that display output and functions that return values.
"""

# I learned how to use functions with lists, dictionaries, 
# if statements, and while loops.

"""
I also saw how to store my functions in separate files called modules, 
so my program files will be simpler and easier to understand.
"""

# I learned to style my functions so my programs will continue to be 
# well-structured and as easy as possible for me and others to read.

# I learned how to use input() to allow users to provide their own information 
# in the programs

# I learned to work with both text and numerical input and how to use 
# while loops to make my programs run as long as I want them to

# I learned several ways to control the flow of a while loop by setting 
# an active flag, using the break statement, and using the continue statement.

# I learned how to use a while loop to move items from one list to another 
# and how to remove all instances of a value from a list.

# I also learned how while loops can be used with dictionaries.

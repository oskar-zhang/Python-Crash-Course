5-8. Hello Admin: Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name
'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user
after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to
each user:
• If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin,
would you like to see a status report?
• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging
in again.
